## Current features
### MVP
- [x] Dungeon explorer minigame where user tries to reach the goal in the smallest number of steps. 
- [x] Random map generation which uses BFS to ensure there is always a path to the goal.
- [ ] Change map sizes and difficulty of map (more or less obstacles).
- [ ] Use BFS to find the shortest path to the goal so that the user can know what number of steps they are aiming to reach.

### Stretch Goals
- [ ] Allow for multiple goal nodes implement a more difficult mode where the user must find the shortest path to all goal nodes.

## Requirements 
Python version 3

## Usage 
In the terminal or a command line client of your choice, go to the folder containing dungeon-explorer.py and run the following command: ```python3 dungeon-explorer.py```.
